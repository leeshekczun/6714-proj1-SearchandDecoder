    "This ipython notebook illustrates the requirements for **COMP6714 Project-1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. You need to implement your code in **`submission.py`** file, provided along with this notebook.\n",
    "2. For all questions, your codes in the file **`submission.py`** need to output your results according to corresponding format specified in **`Proj1-spec.ipynb`**.\n",
    "3. We will not consider any output printed out on the screen. All results should be returned in appropriate data structures return by corresponding functions.\n",
    "4. This Project is not designed to be a full-fledged software program, so we will not evaluate it deliberately using any invalid inputs.\n",
    "5. You are **not allowed** to change the names of the functions to be submitted in **`submission.py`**. \n",
    "6. If you choose to skip a question, leave the corresponding function body in the file **submission.py** as it is (i.e., keep the **`pass`** line), otherwise it will affect your marks for other questions.\n",
    "7. You are allowed to add other functions and import modules (which you may have to in this project), but you are **not allowed to define global variables**, i.e., **only functions are allowed** in **`submission.py`**. Also be careful not to import unnecessary modules, as it may lead to unexpected errors.\n",
    "8. You are allowed to submit as many times as you want before the deadline, but **ONLY the latest version will be kept and marked**.\n",
    "9. For your convenience, we will process your codes submitted before the **Deadline** using a sample dataset, you should not consider these results as your final grades.\n",
    "10. For **Final Grades** we will be using a different test data, so your final scores may vary. We will also check the source code to **ensure** the algorithms specified in the project are implemented. "
